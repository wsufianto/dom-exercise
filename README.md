# DOM Practice

## Description

Here are a few practice exercises to interact with the DOM. Try and complete as much as you can without using the solutions, as we are practicing all the skills involved in web development! I would suggest only looking at the solutions after you have your own working example, or you have exhausted your google searches.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository

2. Open `index.html` in your browser by using `open index.html` in terminal

3. Implement solutions in `index.js` for each of the exercises

**HINT**: Hints are available in the `hints` directory and solutions in `solutions`

Try completing each exercise on your own, before checking the hints or solutions.
